# Products Lab - Data Modeling

## Plan

### Step 1) Come up with a product, make the static design for the data model
* id
* name
* image
* description
* category
* price

### Step 2) Create the Array of Objects
1. At least 5 products
2. Each object has exactly the same keys
3. Create a variable that is an array of all products
4. Export this array

### Step 3) DOM render function
* Create a static HTML of one product card as a guide
* Create a function that will generate the product card for each product

### Step 3A) TDD

### Step 4) Generate Product List
* import data and DOM render function
* locate the element where the products will go
